# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Checklist

## Searching Algorithms
- [x] **Linear Search**: Searches for an element by checking each element in the list one by one.
- [x] **Binary Search**: Searches for an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## Sorting Algorithms
- [x] **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- [x] **Selection Sort**: Divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region and repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region to add to the sorted region.
- [x] **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, assuming the first element is already sorted.
- [x] **Merge Sort**: Divides the list into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- [x] **Quick Sort**: Divides the list into two parts based on a pivot element, sorts the parts, and then merges them.

## Dynamic Programming
- [ ] **Longest Common Subsequence**: Finds the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences.
- [ ] **0/1 Knapsack Problem**: Determines the most valuable subset of items to include in a collection without exceeding a weight limit.
- [ ] **Fibonacci Sequence**: Computes the sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, often used as a classic example of dynamic programming.

## Graph Algorithms
- [ ] **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traverses a graph layer by layer.
- [ ] **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traverses a graph branch by branch.
- [ ] **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
- [ ] **A* Algorithm**: An extension of Dijkstra's algorithm that uses heuristics to find the shortest path.
- [ ] **Kruskal's and Prim's Algorithms**: Find the minimum spanning tree for a connected graph.

## Tree Algorithms
- [ ] **Binary Tree Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order)**: Different ways to traverse a binary tree.
- [ ] **Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations**: Insertion, Deletion, and Searching.
- [ ] **AVL Trees**: Self-balancing binary search trees.

## Greedy Algorithms
- [ ] **Huffman Coding**: Used for data compression.
- [ ] **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: A variant of the 0/1 Knapsack problem allowing fractions of items.

## String Algorithms
- [ ] **Rabin-Karp Algorithm**: A string-searching algorithm that uses hashing.
- [ ] **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm**: Searches for occurrences of a "word" within a main "text string".
- [ ] **Longest Common Prefix**: Finds the longest common starting substring among a set of strings.

## Miscellaneous
- [ ] **Recursion**: Many algorithms, particularly in dynamic programming and tree traversal, are implemented using recursion.
- [ ] **Backtracking**: Used to solve constraint satisfaction problems such as Sudoku and the N-Queens problem.
- [ ] **Bit Manipulation**: Operations involving bitwise operations, often used in low-level programming.
